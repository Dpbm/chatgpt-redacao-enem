I need you to create for me a essay about 'The stigma associated with mental illness in Brazilian society', 
with at most 30 lines (based on the format of a A4 sheet of paper 297x210mm).

The structure that I want is the follow:

It needs to have, at most, 7 lines.
- In the second and third paragraphs, you need to show some arguments that prove your point of view, to do this you must 
use some researches, news, movies, etc. to relate and comprove your vision. These paragraphs need to have 8 lines, at most.
- In the last paragraph, you need to conclude writing a intervention proposal, that is related with your arguments, that is
possible to do, and show: who will solve, what will be done, how it will be done and what's the impact of your solution 
to the problem. With about 7 lines.
