I need you to create for me a essay about 'The stigma associated with mental illness in Brazilian society'.

The structure that I want is the follow:
- In the first paragraph, you need to introduce the reader to theme. You also need to introduce them to your point of view. 
Don't cite the structure that I've told you.
- In the second paragraph, you need to show some arguments that prove your point of view, to do this you must 
use some researches, news, movies, books, thinkers, etc. to relate and comprove your vision. Remember to cite where you 
got the information from.
- In the third paragraph you add more arguments.
- In the end, you need to conclude writing a intervention proposal, that is related with your arguments, that is
possible to do, and show: who will solve, what will be done, how it will be done and what's the impact of your solution 
to the problem. Don't be too detail-oriented, write the proposal with a few sentences. JUST ONE SHORT PARAGRAPH

Note:
 - the text will be write in Brazilian portuguese
 - you need to use the formal language
 - you can't disrespect the human rights
 - There're some skills that will be avaliated like: knowledge about the theme, coherence, cohesion, good structure in 
 your paragraphs and phrases, good argumentation, etc.
- you need to be impersonal
- use the third person
- don't cite the text that I've typed as prompt
